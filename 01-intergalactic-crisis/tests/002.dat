User1: Good morning.
User2: Hello, Doctor.
User1: Now then, how can I help you?
User3: Well doctor, I'm not feeling very well. I've got these awful pains in my stomach and I haven't been sleeping at all well.
User4: Do you have any other symptoms? A temperature, for example?
User2: Well yes, I have had a bit of a high temperature, actually.
User3: It looks to me - as if you've got some kind of a stomach infection.
User1: Oh, have I, doctor?
User4: Yes. Now I'm going to give you these pills. I want you to take two pills three times a day.
User1013: Thank you, doctor, thank you.
